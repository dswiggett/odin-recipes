    <!-- Description and Two Paragraphs-->
    <h2>A delicious pasta alfredo baked to perfection</h2>

    <p>This recipe is quick and easy and any novice cook can do it. It was made for the little ones who always wanted to order out at Pizza Hut® or Olive Garden®. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese if desired. This recipe can also be eaten without being baked but the kids love that it resembles baked casseroles found in restaurants.</p>

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (i ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li> 2 chicken breasts, patted dry</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Directions -->
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add minced garlic; saute until golden, about 30 seconds. Stir in cream cheese until smooth. Add milk; stir until there are no lumps. Lower heat to medium. Add 3/4 of the Parmesan cheese, parsley, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and garlic powder on both sides. Cook chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 6 minutes per side. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Butter bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Cover bottom with a layer of pasta. Place half of the chicken cubes on top. Pour 1/2 of the sauce over the chicken. Repeat layering pasta, chicken, and sauce. Sprinkle top with remaining Parmesan cheese. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, about 15 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until cheese is golden, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
